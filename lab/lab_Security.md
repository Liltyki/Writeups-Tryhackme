# How I Secured My Cybersecurity Lab

## Introduction

As part of my cybersecurity journey, I decided to build a personal lab to practice both Red Team and Blue Team techniques. This lab runs on a VPS hosted  and uses Docker to simulate real-world attack and defense scenarios.
But building a secure lab is very important . A poorly secured lab exposed to the internet is a real target, and through this process path to secure my own lab i learned a  lot , no longer theory its time to practice.

## Part 1 — The Foundation : Choosing a VPS

I chose OVH as my VPS provider for several reasons , it is a French provider, reliable, affordable, and includes built-in DDoS protection.  As OS version i choose Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, the reason to not take the last version is for the documentation the 22.04  brought and the stability to this OS. Obviously i will need to upgrade to a newest version in a few years but i'm fine for the 5 next years due to the support. 

The first thing I did after connecting for the first time was update the system :

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Never skip this step. Running outdated packages means running known vulnerabilities. With a updated Packages the only danger for me now is Zero-Day vulnerability.

## Part 2 — SSH Hardening

SSH is the main entry point to my server. Leaving it with default settings would be dangerous and easy to gain access for a malicious attacker. I have in mind to change port , use a MFA (multi-factor authentication), create Key pair and change several options .

### My keys pair with ed25519  ?

I generated my SSH key pair using the **ed25519** algorithm instead of the traditional RSA. I decided to use ed25519 because in theory this is  stronger and we can consider RSA as a old cryptograpy. Still usable but ed25519 make me a better choice in this case! 

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "lab-ovh"
```
This command generates two files :
- id_ed25519   → the private key (never shared)
- id_ed25519.pub → the public key (copied to the VPS)

The private key stays on my machine. The public key is copied to the VPS using :
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ubuntu@IP -p 2222
```
This adds my public key to  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server.

When I connect, SSH verifies that my private key matches the public key on the server without ever sending the private key over the network.

I also created a backup of my private key on an encrypted USB drive. If I lose my machine, I can still access my server.

### MFA on SSH — Two Factors to Connect

I configured SSH to require **both** a private key **and** a password to connect. This is Multi-Factor Authentication applied to SSH :

- **Something you have** → the private key file stored on my machine
- **Something you know** → the password

In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` :

```
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
AuthenticationMethods publickey,password
```

This means that even if an attacker steals my password, they cannot connect without the private key  and vice versa.

### Additional SSH Hardening

```
PermitRootLogin no       # Root cannot login via SSH
MaxAuthTries 5           # Max 5 attempts before disconnect
Port 2222                # Custom port — avoids automated scans on port 22
```

Changing the default port from 22 to 2222 does not add security by itself, but it significantly reduces noise from automated scanners that target port 22.

---

## Part 3 — Firewall with UFW

UFW is my first line of defense against unwanted connections, my firewall.

### Default Deny Policy

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

This is the whitelist approach everything is blocked by default, i only allow what i need. This is much safer than a blacklist approach where you try to block known threats.

### Allowed Ports

```bash
sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp   # SSH
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp  # WireGuard VPN
```

That is it. Only two ports are publicly accessible. Everything else like DVWN, Wireshark, vm kali .... is only accessible through the WireGuard tunnel.

---

## Part 4 — Fail2ban : Automated Brute Force Protection

Fail2ban monitors authentication logs and automatically bans IPs that fail too many times.

My configuration in `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` :

```ini
[DEFAULT]
bantime = 3600    # Ban for 1 hour
findtime = 600    # Detection window : 10 minutes
maxretry = 5      # Max 5 failed attempts

[sshd]
enabled = true
port = 2222
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
```

**Why jail.local and not jail.conf ?**
`jail.conf` is overwritten during Fail2ban updates. Always use `jail.local` for custom configuration  it is never touched by updates.

## Part 5 — WireGuard VPN : My Personal Encrypted Tunnel

WireGuard transforms my VPS into a personal VPN server. It creates an encrypted tunnel between my  machine and the VPS. It is very interesting because if i have to work on a non professional environment like my home or a public wifi is the minimum to encrypted what i'm doing ! 

### Why WireGuard ?

After few research i find Wireguard a modern VPN protocol integrated into the linux Kernel.  It uses **ChaCha20** for encryption and **Curve25519** for key exchange.

### How It Works

```
Kali VM (10.8.0.2)
      ↓
  [ChaCha20 encrypted tunnel]
      ↓
VPS OVH (10.8.0.1 / 135.XXX.XXX.XXX)
      ↓
   Internet
```

Once connected to the VPN, my real IP is hidden behind the VPS IP. My ISP only sees an encrypted connection to OVH ,not what I am doing.

### The MFA Analogy

Just like SSH MFA, WireGuard uses asymmetric cryptography :

- **Private key** → stays on my machine, never shared
- **Public key** → shared with the server to verify identity

---

## Part 6 — Docker Lab Isolation

My lab runs inside Docker containers on the VPS. Each container represents a machine in a simulated network. Docker allows me to isolate each environment in its own container.If a vulnerable container like DVWA 
is compromised, the attacker is contained inside that container and cannot directly access the host system.

It also allows me to instantly reset a compromised environment with a single command —> docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d . something impossible with a real machine.

### Internal Network
All containers communicate on an isolated internal network 192.XXX.XXX.0/24 :
```
kali_attacker  → 192.XXX.XXX.10
target_ssh     → 192.XXX.XXX.20
dvwa_web       → 192.XXX.XXX.30
wireshark      → 192.XXX.XXX.40
```

No traffic leaves this network to the internet  it is completely isolated.

### Binding Ports to WireGuard Only

By default, Docker exposes ports on all interfaces, meaning anyone on the internet could reach my vulnerable containers. I fixed this by binding ports exclusively to the WireGuard interface :

```yaml
ports:
  - "10.8.0.1:8080:80"    # DVWA — WireGuard only
  - "10.8.0.1:2223:22"    # Target SSH — WireGuard only
  - "10.8.0.1:3000:3000"  # Wireshark — WireGuard only
```

Now only someone connected to my WireGuard VPN can access these services.

### Continuous Traffic Capture

I configured a TCPDump container that captures all network traffic continuously :

```yaml
tcpdump:
  image: nicolaka/netshoot
  network_mode: "host"
  command: tcpdump -i any -w /captures/capture_$(date).pcap
```

Combined with a daily cron job that deletes captures older than 24 hours, this gives me a rolling log of all lab activity without filling up the disk.

## What I Learned


Security is not a single action it is a stack of layers. Each layer alone can be bypassed, but combined they make the attacker's job harder. This Lab allow me to use a few different technology , like Wireguard and Docker in more deep. Lot of documentation review , video ... But now i can apply what i learn here in a real situation ! 

Lot of concept used here was learn during my Security+ Lesson with Andrew Ramdayal , and at that time i was like "everything is very interesting but how i will used it " Know is done .
