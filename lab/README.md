# 🔬 Personal Cybersecurity Lab


## 📖 Introduction

One of the most important steps when entering the cybersecurity field is **building your own lab**.

Having a personal lab matters for several reasons. It allows you to develop hands-on skills, host virtual machines, simulate both **Red Team** and **Blue Team** scenarios, and understand technologies you will face in real-world environments.

## 🎯 Goals

At the time of writing, my objectives for this lab are:

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🖥️ **Offload heavy tasks** | Run resource-intensive operations such as brute force attacks from a dedicated VPS |
| ⚔️ **Attack & Defense simulations** | Simulate Red Team and Blue Team scenarios using Docker containers |
| 🔒 **Personal VPN** | Enhance privacy and secure access to the lab via a WireGuard VPN |

## 🔐 Security Configuration

- **SSH** — Port 2222, MFA enforced (public key + password)
  - *Something you have* → Private SSH key
  - *Something you know* → Password
- **Firewall** — UFW with default deny incoming policy
- **Fail2ban** — Auto-ban after 5 failed attempts (1h ban)
- **Root login** — Disabled (`PermitRootLogin no`)
